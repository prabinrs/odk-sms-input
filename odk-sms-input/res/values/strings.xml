    <string name="welcome_message">ODK SMS Input allows you to read, parse, and
        insert SMS messages into ODK 2.0 apps. Once configured, incoming 
        messages will be saved into this app\'s database as well as other ODK
        apps that have SMS input enabled. Messages are saved into their own
        table, with the message and sender unparsed. More complicated parsing
        that allows inserting data into arbitrary tables is also supported. Use
        this screen to inspect messages that have been processed and to see
        which installed apps have SMS input enabled.</string>
